## Introduction

This guide will help you get started with our brand guidelines and design system. Our design system is built using Web Awesome components, providing a modern and accessible foundation for all our digital products.

## Installation

To use our design system in your project, you'll need to include the Web Awesome CSS and JavaScript files:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/webawesome/styles/webawesome.css">
<script type="module" src="/webawesome/webawesome.loader.js" data-webawesome="/webawesome"></script>
```

## Basic Usage

Once you've included the Web Awesome files, you can start using components immediately:

```html
<wa-button variant="primary">Click Me</wa-button>
<wa-card>
  <h3>Card Title</h3>
  <p>Card content goes here.</p>
</wa-card>
```
