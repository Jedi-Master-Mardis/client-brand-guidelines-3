## Writing Style Guide

This guide provides specific rules and recommendations for written communications.

## Grammar and Style

### Active Voice
Prefer active voice over passive voice for clarity and impact.

**Good**: "We deliver exceptional service."  
**Avoid**: "Exceptional service is delivered by us."

### Sentence Length
Keep sentences concise and clear. Aim for 15-20 words on average.

### Paragraph Length
Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences) for better readability, especially online.

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms
- **Service-focused language**: "service," "reliability," "professional," "exceptional"
- **Action-oriented words**: "deliver," "ensure," "provide," "guarantee"
- **Clear, simple language**: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- **Industry-appropriate terms**: Use technical terms when communicating with industry professionals (fuel types, equipment specifications)

### Words to Avoid
- Vague promises without specifics
- Overly casual language that undermines professionalism
- Negative language or comparisons with competitors
- Clichés that don't reflect our authentic brand voice

## Formatting

### Headlines
- Use sentence case for most headlines
- Keep headlines concise and descriptive

- "24/7, 365 days a year" (when describing availability)
- "Ensuring maximum performance with no downtime"
- "Professional services you can count on"
